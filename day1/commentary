p←⍉↑⍎¨⊃⎕NGET'input'1

Step by step:
⎕NGET'input'1 - get the contents of the file 'input'
⊃ - pick the contents of the file
⍎¨ - evaluate each element of the array (turn them into a pair of numbers)
⍉↑ - transpose the resulting array and convert it to a matrix of two rows

+/|-⌿{⍵[⍋⍵]}⍤1⊢p ⍝ part1

Step by step:
⍤1⊢p - iterate over the first axis of the array p
{⍵[⍋⍵]} - sort the array
-⌿ - subtract the first row from the last row, giving us the difference between the two
+/ - sum the resulting list of differences

+/,{⍵×+/⍵=1⌷p}¨⍪0⌷p ⍝ part2

Step by step:
¨⍪0⌷p - Apply the function over each item in the first column 
in the array

⍵×+/⍵=1⌷p - Create a binary array (0 1 1 0 etc) of 
the entries in the second column which match the value we are looking for, sum those up and multiply
by the searched for value

+/, - sum the resulting list of results
